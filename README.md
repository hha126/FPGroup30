CS 32 FINAL PROJECT: World Bank Data Country Analysis \
By Annabelle Finlayson, Hope Ha, and Larry Jia. 

Our project takes user input for a country and four World Bank variables and returns background information, statistics, graphs, rankings, and comparable countries.  All statistics are calculated according to World Bank data (https://data.worldbank.org/?most_recent_value_desc=true). We also make use of this csv, https://gist.github.com/radcliff/f09c0f88344a7fcef373, which must be uploaded to the environment, a copy of which is in our github.
