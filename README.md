CS32 2022 Final Project // Annabelle Finlayson and Hope Ha <br/> 
Our project is to create a data analytics program where a user can upload data, specify what they want done to the data, and then, depending on user input, clean the data (have repeated values removed, separate columns, round values up or down, etc.) and return relevant statistics. If we have time, we could also visualize the data. The steps to complete this task are: <br/> 
1. Get the data from the user (either uploading a file or grabbing it off the web?) and what they want done to the data: cleaning, certain statistics, or analyses <br/> 
2. If necessary, translate spreadsheet data into usable python data <br/> 
3. Perform user inputted cleaning tasks <br/> 
4. Calculate user inputted statistics (i.e. mean, variance, max/min, correlation, regression, etc.) <br/> 
5. Output data visualizations (i.e. scatterplot, histogram, etc.) <br/>
