CS 32 FINAL PROJECT: World Bank Data Country Analysis \
By Annabelle Finlayson, Hope Ha, and Larry Jia. \

Our project takes user input for a country and four World Bank variables and returns background information, statistics, graphs, rankings, and comparable countries and territories.  All statistics are calculated according to World Bank data (https://data.worldbank.org/?most_recent_value_desc=true). We also make use of this csv, https://gist.github.com/radcliff/f09c0f88344a7fcef373, which must be uploaded to the environment, a copy of which is in our github. \ 

One limitation in the comparable country and territory block code is that currently if the chosen country has no 2020 data for any of the indicators, it simply drops that indicator from the analysis. Therefore, one next step for the country comparison block code would be to make it possible for the user to choose whether to drop that indicator from the analysis or to rather conduct the analysis on the most recent year for which data was recorded for all of the chosen indicators.
